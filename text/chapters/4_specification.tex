\chapter{Specification}
In this chapter the general outline of the application is specified via functional and non-functional requirements.
Some of the features are based on the feedback from the survey and short in-person interviews,
while others are based on the analysis of the existing platforms.
The individual requirements are ordered based on the 'MoSCoW' criteria, i.e. from most to least important.
